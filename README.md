HabitHub — Personal Habit Tracker and Community Challenge Platform

HabitHub lets individuals set daily/weekly habits, track their progress visually, and join group challenges for motivation. The platform uses gamified feedback and community features to help users build better routines—fitness, learning, sleep, mindfulness, study, etc.
